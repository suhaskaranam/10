In JavaScript, operator precedence and associativity determine the order of operations when multiple operators are used in an expression.

Precedence

Precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.

Table: Operator Precedence (High to Low)

| Precedence | Operators |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | () (grouping) |
| 2 | ++, -- (unary) |
| 3 | !, ~, typeof, void (unary) |
| 4 | *, /, % (multiplicative) |
| 5 | +, - (additive) |
| 6 | <<, >>, >>> (bitwise shift) |
| 7 | <, >, <=, >= (comparison) |
| 8 | ==, !=, ===, !== (equality) |
| 9 | & (bitwise AND) |
| 10 | ^ (bitwise XOR) |
| 11 | | (bitwise OR) |
| 12 | && (logical AND) |
| 13 | || (logical OR) |
| 14 | ?: (ternary) |
| 15 | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (assignment) |
| 16 | , (comma) |

Associativity

Associativity defines the order in which operators with the same precedence are evaluated.

Table: Operator Associativity

| Associativity | Operators |
| --- | --- |
| Left-to-Right | Most operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) |
| Right-to-Left | Assignment operators (e.g., =, +=, -=) |

Importance

Understanding precedence and associativity:

1. Avoids ambiguity: Clarifies operator order, ensuring intended behavior.
2. Prevents errors: Incorrect precedence can lead to unexpected results.
3. Improves readability: Explicit grouping (e.g., ()) enhances code clarity.
4. Simplifies debugging: Easier identification of issues.
5. Enhances code quality: Better understanding leads to more maintainable code.

Best Practices

1. Use parentheses for clarity.
2. Follow operator precedence rules.
3. Avoid complex expressions; break into simpler ones.
4. Document complex logic.

Example:

// Without explicit grouping
let result = 2 + 3 * 4;

// With explicit grouping
let result = 2 + (3 * 4);

By grasping precedence and associativity, developers write more effective, readable, and maintainable JavaScript code.
